Research & Work Experience
======
* **Jan 2025 - Present: Research Assistant (Tuning-free First Order Methods)**
  * Shanghai Jiao Tong University
  * Supervisor: Prof. Qi Deng
  * Propose an accelerated distance-adaptive method which achieves optimal anytime convergence rates for Hölder smooth problems without requiring prior knowledge of smoothness parameters or explicit parameter tuning.
  * Extend to convex problems with linear constraint and stochastic gradient.

* **Sept 2025 - Present: Research Assistant (Schedule Free Method and Preconditioner)**
  * Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Stanford University
  * Supervisor: Prof. Qi Deng, Prof. Yinyu Ye
  * Show operator norm has some advantage beyond other norm in matrix optimizer.
  * Apply online scaling method to achieve better performance than the schedule-free approach.

* **Sept 2024 - Feb 2025: Research Assistant (Online Robust Mechanism on Cooperative Games)**
  * Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE)
  * Supervisor: Prof. Hu Fu and Prof. Zhihao Gavin Tang
  * Constructed a counterexample showing that no mechanism can achieve the approximation rate beyond O(1/k).
  * Proved that with partial information about the value function, linear programming can be used to design a complete mechanism.
